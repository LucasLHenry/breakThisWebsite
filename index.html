              If a website is "unsafe", that tipically means it is vulnerable to at least one of these types of attacks.

                  Manipulation of items in a database using a coding language called SQL. This
                  abuses the vulnerability of making the computer think that your search is not just text, but actual
                  instructions. This primarily affects the server and not the users, but it can be made to also affect users.

                  Tricking a user into submitting a malicious request to a website that requires credentials by using
                  those already obtained by logging in to the website. This can be done by making a link that does the 
                  malicious action and tricking the victim into clicking on it.

                  Injecting malicious javascript through user input into an average website to be executed as part of the it.
                  It is usually inputed through normal input fields, and can sometimes corrupt the entire website. This is only
                  doable if the website does not implement proper input sanitization.

                If you use an online store vulnerable to SQLi, any attacker could steal your username, password, credit card number, 
                and everything you've every purchased with only one line of code.

              <p class="main-page-medium-text">
                If you have an account at a bank, and their website is vulnerable to CSRF, your entire balance could be solen and your account

                If you're on a blog that's vulnerable to XSS and someone happens to have written a comment that uses XSS, you
                could be redirected to a fake website that tricks you into giving up valuable infromation without you even knowing
                anything has happened.

          </h1>
          <p class="main-page-medium-text">
            There are lots of things to look for on an unsafe website, here are some of them:

          <div id="protect-flex-container">
            <div class="protect-flex" id="general">
              <header id="general-header" class="protect-flex-header">
                <h1 id="general-h1" class="protect-h1">General</h1>
              </header>
              <div id="general-body">
                <ul>
                  <li>Look for <code>https</code> instead of <code>http</code> in the url bar. That means that
                  all the information you send to the website is encrypted (scrambled in a special way) so that
                  no one else can understand it.</li>
                  <li>Look for the lock &#x1F512<!--Unicode Lock--> symbol in the address bar. That means that the
                  website is using the proper security standards. Note: this does <u>not</u> guarrantee that a website
                  is safe. There have been examples of malicious websites that still get the lock icon.</li>
                </ul>
